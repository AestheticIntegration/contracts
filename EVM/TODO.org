* TODO:
** TODO Extend memory model for reads/writes not at word boundaries (a mod 32 <> 0) 
** TODO Proper gas calculations for CREATE instructions (nested mem_extend_ok's)
** TODO Update gas calculations for Oct/Nov, 2016 hard fork(s)
** TODO Proper behaviour (failure) when JUMP* destination invalid 
** TODO Copy proper memory subsequences from *CALL* results
** TODO Check CodeSize (and ExtCodeSize) computation -- is it # of instructions? # of bytes? 
** TODO Implement SHA3 in logic: currently it's an uninterpreted function
** TODO Implement SStore refund semantics 
** TODO Overflow semantics for program counter increment (s.pc + 1 when s.pc = max_word)?
Currently, we treat s.pc as arbitrary precision.
This is a moot point in practice, but we should clarify w.r.t. official semantics.
