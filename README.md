# Imandra Contracts

![Imandra Contracts](media/ic_logo.png "Imandra Contracts")

Imandra Contracts is a platform for analysing and reasoning about smart contracts, built on top of the Imandra formal verification system.

### Community Models
This repository contains our *community models*.
These models customise Imandra for reasoning about various classes of smart contracts.

### Ethereum 

Our first community model is an Imandra model of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
This model provides an *executable operational semantics* for the EVM, empowering Imandra to reason about Ethereum bytecode.

### Resources

For a quick example, see EVM/README. For more, see [docs.imandra.ai](http://docs.imandra.ai "Imandra documentation").

### Get Involved
